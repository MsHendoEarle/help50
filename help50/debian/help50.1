.SH NAME
help50 \- a command-line tool that translates errors
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B help50
.RI [ -i ] " COMMAND"
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B help50
is a command line tool that makes an effort to translate some of the more arcane error messages that other tools, such as
.B clang
or
.B valgrind
, sometimes spit out. In this way, it serves as a "virtual TF" of sorts, hopefully helping nudge students in the right direction when a little bit of translation of the error message is really all thatâ€™s needed to move on.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-i
Run interactive command.
